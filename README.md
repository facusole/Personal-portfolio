## Description

This website was built in React.js, since it's the most popular framework right now, and vanilla CSS, because I love writing it. This project consists in my
own personal website, that showcases both my skills and other projects.
<br/>
It's a SPA with react-router as my Routing library and react-reveal as my animation library. It's a simple website to introduce myself.
